# Files required for this project

A description of the dataset can be obtained at this site:

The following data files are required to conduct this project:
  - subject_test.txt
  - X_test.txt
  - y_test.txt
  - subject_train.txt
  - X_train.txt
  - y_train.txt
  
  -features.txt
  -features_info.txt
  -activity_labels.txt
  
  
The following transformations and mergers were performed
  
  - The x_test.txt and x_train.txt were merged into one dataset called xsignals which represent variables. 
  - The y_test.txt and y_train.txt were merged into one dataset called ysignals which represents activities.
  - The subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt were merged into one datase called subjects.
  - The features.txt was used to set the names of the xsignals dataset.
  - The measurements on the meand and standard deviation were stracted from the xsignals dataset.
  - The subject, x_signals and y_signalst datesets were merged into a new dataset called data.
  - The acativlity_labels.txt file was used to label activity data. The following lables 
    were used:WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
  - The following variable names were re-labeled for improved description of data:
      -X to XAxis
      -Y to YAxis
      -Z to ZAxis
      -mean to Mean
      -std to StandardDeviation
      -tbody to Body
      -BodyBody to Body
      -tBody to Body
      -fBody to FFTBody
      -tGravity to Gravity
      -fGravity to FFTGravity
      -ACC to Acceleration
      -GYRO to Angular Velocity
      -Mag to Magniture
  - The data was Grouped by subject and activity
  - The data was summarized by average of each variable
